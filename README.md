# chat-bot
A basic chat bot web app is built from scratch with html, css and js with no APIs but it's ready to use an external API.
Bot will answer if user input contains one of those keys :
```javascript
const responseObj = {
    hi: "hii",
    hii: "hii",
    hello: "hello, what's up",
    "how are u" : "fine",
    hru: "fine",
    "how r u": "fine",
    hhh: "have fun ^^"
}
```
